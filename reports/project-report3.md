# Idea description

* Encrypted peer-to-peer messaging
* Uses Estonian ID system for both identification and encryption
* Pass messages to offline users by holding them with mutual friends
* Designated servers that pass messages to offline peers

# Milestone 3
## Goals 

- EID integration
- Sending messages to offline parties
- NAT traversal
- P2P operation optimization
- Quality of life improvements(use contact name instead of id code)

## Actual work done 

- EID integration (Andrew and Mattias)
- Initial NAT traversal server (Jüri and Mattias)
- QoL improvements (Tambet)
- Some P2P operation optimizations(Mattias)

# Next milestone
- Sending messages to offline parties
- NAT traversal server supports P2P operations
- P2P operation optimization
