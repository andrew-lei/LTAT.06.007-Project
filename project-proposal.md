# Idea description

* Peer-to-peer messaging
* Use Estonian ID system for both identification and encryption
* Pass messages to offline users by holding them with mutual friends

# Related work

* Signal
    - End-to-end message encryption instead of peer-to-peer
* Bitmessage
    - Peer-to-peer, stores messages on P2P network
    - Requires proof-of-work for anti-spam
    - Proof-of-work less practical for sending messages on mobile devices
